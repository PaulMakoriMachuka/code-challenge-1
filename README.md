##  Kenyan Chai, Boda Fare & Mobile Money Fee Estimators

##  Description

This repository by **Paul Machuka Makori** contains three beginner-friendly JavaScript programs that simulate practical day-to-day Kenyan use cases:

1. **Chai Bora Ingredient Calculator** – Estimate how much water, milk, tea leaves, and sugar you need for a given number of cups of chai.
2. **Boda Boda Fare Estimator** – Calculate how much a boda boda trip will cost based on the distance in kilometers.
3. **Mobile Money Transaction Fee Estimator** – Simulate how much will be charged when sending money based on a 1.5% fee structure.

Each mini-app runs in the console, allowing new developers to understand user input, mathematical logic, and output formatting.
